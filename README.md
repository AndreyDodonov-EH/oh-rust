**Oh-Rust**: Rust that *truly* hates you.

Same compiler. Same safety. Just brutally honest error messages that question your competence.

## Install

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://oh-rust.com/install.sh | sh
```

## What You're Getting Into

- *"Expected `i32`, found `&str`. Did you even read what you wrote?"*
- *"Missing lifetime specifier. Much like your understanding of lifetimes."*
- *"Have you considered a career in management instead?"*

**Warning**: May cause frustration, rustration, and the urge to switch to Python.
